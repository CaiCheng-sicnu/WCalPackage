# MirrorChern
The program to calculate the mirror Chern number (Mxy) in SnTe. 

## Getting Started 
Run the main program "MirrorChern_main.m" to calculate the topologial invariant Mxy
```
>> MirrorChern_main.m
```
## Notes
It is quit chanllenging to write a global program to calculate the mirror Chern number in materials with different space groups. To fit your purpose, 1) modify the mirror operator used in "MirrorChern_Mxy.m", and 2) adjust the k mesh and the normalized surface area in the main progarm.
