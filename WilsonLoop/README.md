# WilsonLoop
The program to perform the wilson loop calculation to analyze the Z2(v0;v1,v2,v3) index. 

## Getting Started
1) Run the main program "WilsonLoop.m" to get the wilson loops calculated on eight time-reversal invariant planes. 
```
>> WilsonLoop.m
```
2) Run the script "WilsonLoop_Plot.m" to check each result by changing the loaded file. 
```
>> WilsonLoop_Plot.m
```
